  	<h1>Simple example - Node.js, Restify, MongoDb and Mongoose</h1>
  	<p>
  		 Simple is a relative term. It may seem simple compared to the complexity of the end application or building anything with Java but to the n00b developer it will most likely be pretty challenging and the concepts are difficult to wrap your head around. I wanted to learn how to create a server with node that could serve up html, css, js, and then persist data to mongodb. I imagine you are for a similar reason. 
  	</p>
  	<p>Check list</p>
  	<ul>
  		 <li>1. Have you installed and started mongod in your terminal window?</li>
  		 <li>2. Have you opened a second terminal window and created a sample message in the messages colletion of your local mongodb database?</li>
  		 <li>3. Have you opened a third terminal window and started the node server?</li>
  		 <li>4. Did you actually read the bloody README.md file?!</li>
  	</ul>

  		If you start to see your messages build up in the Message box above, congratulations! You've successfully setup this simple demo. Personall, I found this tutoral quite difficult but as I did research it kept stalking me; popping into the top of my search results. Thus, I felt compelled to wrestle with it; make it work for me and then share my work.

  		And here's where you could help... I'm currently stuck on the final deployment to Nodjitsu but I'm getting ahead of myself here as the focus of this tutorial is one based on locally hosted files. Working with a platform like Heruko or Nodejitsu should be saved for a Part 2 of this tutorial since putting on this awesomeness on the net for our world to see is the ultimate goal.
